Hello,  
  
In addition to my previous response, I would like to request you to allow us to reduce the severity of this ticket for now, since this issue does not satisfy our criteria for severity-2 issue.

So please let us know if it is okay to reduce the severity of ticket further. If not, then can you provide us any information on how severe this issue is and how severe business impact it is causing to your production.
