>>> COLLABORATION REQUEST <<<

ENVIRONMENT:
- RHEL 6.9

SPECIFICS:
- customer's problem:
 - customer has a application whose dynamic libraries are on a NAS.
 - cgroup for memory limits has been used for this application.
 - In RHEL 6, system will reclaim parts of dynamic libraries in memory, create memory space for new requirements, which causes system has to re-allocate dynamic libraries from NAS, network bandwidth and I/O wastes.
 - customer expects an oom instead of reload dynamic libraries from NAS, because it will take up lots of network bandwidth and I/O.
 - customer expects the dynamic libraries locked in the memory without any releases.

- set up a cgroup with a memory limits for an application.
- no swap space in the system.
- In RHEL 6, the system will reclaim the page cache and provide memory space for the application when memory usage is closed to the limit.
- In RHEL 7, when the memory usage is up to the limit, OOM will be trigger to kill relative processes.

- how to use the test program:
1. compile the share library:
gcc so_test.c -fPIC -shared -o libtest.so
In RHEL 6:
1. set up a cgroup
[root@test ~]# /etc/init.d/cgconfig start
[root@test ~]# cd /cgroup/memory/
[root@test memory]# mkdir cache
[root@test memory]# cd cache
[root@test cache]# echo '500000000' > memory.limit_in_bytes
[root@test cache]# echo '500000000' > memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes
2. compile the test.c and set it to the cgroup
1. gcc test.c -L. -ltest -o test
2. set it to the cgroup
./creatcgroup.sh

In RHEL 7:
1. cd /root/Case/02141589
2. gcc test.c -L. -ltest -o test
3. ./createcgroup.sh


STEPS TAKEN:
- RHEL 6 test env IP: 10.44.128.93 username: root password: RedHat1! test program location: /root
- RHEL 7 test env IP: 10.72.37.113 username: root password: redhat   test program location: /root/Case/02141589



REQUESTED ACTION:
- any methods we can use to lock the dynamic libraries in the memory without any releases?
